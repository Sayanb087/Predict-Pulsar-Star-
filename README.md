# üíª SVM-Based Classification for Predictive Modeling
## üåê Project Overview
This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to a structured dataset for predictive modeling. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. The objective is to preprocess the dataset, apply feature engineering, train multiple SVM models using different kernels, and evaluate their performance using standard classification metrics.

## ü§ñ What is SVM (Support Vector Machine)?
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin.
Key Concepts:
* Hyperplane: A decision boundary that separates different classes.
* Margin: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class (called support vectors).
* Kernels: Functions that allow SVMs to perform non-linear classification by projecting data into higher dimensions.
Common kernels:
* Linear: Suitable for linearly separable data.
* Polynomial: Captures polynomial relationships.
* RBF (Radial Basis Function): Most used; captures non-linear patterns.
* Sigmoid: Similar to neural network activation functions.

## üìä Dataset Overview
The dataset contains features and a target label used for binary classification. The features can be categorical, numerical, or mixed.

### Example Features (Varies by Dataset):
* Age, salary, education
* Sensor readings, medical test values
* Image-based features
### Target:
A binary label indicating class membership, such as:
* 1 = Positive class
* 0 = Negative class

## üßπ Data Preprocessing
* Handling Missing Values: Replace missing entries with median or mode.
* Label Encoding: Convert categorical values into numeric codes.
* Feature Scaling: SVM is sensitive to feature magnitude; we apply StandardScaler to normalize data.
* Train-Test Split: Dataset is divided typically into 80% training and 20% testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Training and Kernels

### 1. Linear SVM:
        from sklearn.svm import SVC
        model = SVC(kernel='linear')
        model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
### 2. RBF Kernel:
        model = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='scale')
* C (Regularization Parameter): Controls tradeoff between maximizing margin and minimizing classification error.
* Gamma: Defines how far the influence of a single training point reaches.

## üßÆ Evaluation Metrics
### ‚úÖ Accuracy
Measures the overall correctness:
* Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

### üìä Confusion Matrix
A 2x2 table showing:
* TP (True Positives): Correctly predicted positives
* TN (True Negatives): Correctly predicted negatives
* FP (False Positives): Incorrectly predicted positives
* FN (False Negatives): Incorrectly predicted negatives

### üìã Classification Report
Includes:
* Precision: TP / (TP + FP)
* Recall: TP / (TP + FN)
* F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
* Support: Number of actual occurrences of each class

## üìà Visualization and Interpretation
* Confusion Matrix Heatmap: Visualizes prediction vs. actual.
* Decision Boundary Plot: Only applicable in 2D or using PCA for dimensionality reduction.
* Accuracy vs Kernel Type Bar Chart

## üß™ Cross-Validation:
To avoid overfitting, K-Fold Cross-Validation is used to test model performance on multiple data splits.

## üìå Additional Concepts
### Epoch:
Epoch is a term used in neural networks and deep learning to denote a complete pass through the training data. It is not directly applicable in SVMs.
### Loss Function in SVM:
SVMs use hinge loss to penalize incorrect classifications:
* Loss = max(0, 1 - y*(wx + b))
### Optimization in SVM:
SVMs solve a convex optimization problem to find the best hyperplane. The C parameter helps balance margin size vs. classification error.

## üßæ Summary
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines for binary classification problems. With thorough preprocessing, kernel experimentation, and metric evaluation, it provides insights into the mechanics and performance of SVM models. Future work can include tuning hyperparameters via grid search and comparing SVM with tree-based classifiers or neural networks.
